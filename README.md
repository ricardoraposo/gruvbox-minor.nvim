Neovim theme heavily based on the [Gruvbox Minor VSCode theme](https://github.com/adamsome/vscode-theme-gruvbox-minor), written in Lua with Treesitter support!

This colorscheme was made for personal use.<br>
I mainly code in Typescript and Golang, so there might be a few highlight groups that were not set yet.
I also use treesitter, so I didn't bother making the theme work without it.
Therefore, PR's are more than welcome.
